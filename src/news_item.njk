                The Minister of Finance, Mrs Zainab Ahmed has inaugurated the Steering Committee for “Project Lighthouse” to boost the revenue of the nation.
            </b>
            <p>
                The Committee is chaired by the Minister with the Permanent Secretary, Special Duties at the Ministry, Dr MK Dikwa, as Deputy Chair. The Presidential Initiatives for Continuous Audit (PICA) and Department of Technical Services at the ministry would serve as the secretariat of the Project Lighthouse. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Minister in her inaugural address noted that, over the years, many initiatives and policies have been lunched and implemented by the Federal Government under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of Finance. According to her, “Despite the fact that we live in a technology and data-centric world, we have not had a culture of using data and information to guide the formulation, implementation and impact assessment of our initiatives and policies or even in carrying out our mandate as a Ministry.
                            
                “You will recall that one of the key economic policy objectives of the current administration, as contained in the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), is improving overall Federal Government revenues by targeting and increasing revenues from non-oil revenue sources. “You will also recall that in the last few months, major steps have been taken to address our chronic revenue challenges. One of such steps is the launch of the Strategic Revenue Growth Initiatives (SRGI), which some of you have been participating in. “Following the ratification of Project Lighthouse at Federal Executive (FEC) on Wednesday 9th May, 2019, the Federal Ministry of Finance is entering in a post-VAIDS or Phase 2 of the Project.

                “However, this time around, Project Lighthouse is being positioned as a ‘single source of truth’ for revenue and tax related intelligence that will support the Ministry, its agencies, revenue agencies, tax authorities and other stakeholders to be better positioned to address the revenue challenges we are facing.

            <p>           
                She stressed that ministry under Project Lighthouse, “will be using Big Data analytics, date sciences and related technologies to gather and analyse financial data and revenue related data from multiple but related sources. We would also use the sophisticated date analysis tools to ‘connect the dots’ between different data sets. 
            </p>
