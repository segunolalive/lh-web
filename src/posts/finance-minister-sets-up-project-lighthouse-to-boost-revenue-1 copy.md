The Minister of Finance, Mrs Zainab Ahmed has inaugurated the Steering Committee for “Project Lighthouse” to boost the revenue.

In 2017, the Federal Government of Nigeria inaugurated a committee to oversee the implementation of a compliance scheme seeking ways to reduce budget deficits and tax shortfalls while simultaneously managing revenue more efficiently and diversifying revenue sources by improving revenue generation in the non-oil sector of the economy.

Hence, the introduction of Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS) on 29 June 2017, which was a compliance strategy with a time-threshold opportunity for taxpayers at the Federal and State levels to regularize their tax status relating to previous tax periods. Full and honest declarants of previously undisclosed assets and income during the window provided shall be forgiven of interest and penalties on overdue taxes and the assurance that they will not face criminal prosecution for tax offences or be subject to tax investigation.

In that regard, the Federal Ministry of Finance piloted Project Lighthouse, which involved the aggregation, centralization and analysis of nationwide tax payer data within the Federal Ministry of Finance. The objective of Lighthouse was for data to be aggregated from key data sources and Lighthouse would provide the intelligence and profiling engine for more efficient and intelligent data driven tax assessments, thus ensuring major tax loopholes are plugged and revenues dramatically increased.
